1) Crashes repeatedly 2) Takes Century to Boot 3) Repeatedly requires Update which is very annoying. 4) It doesn't ask for Password for one step confirmation when transferring money. 5) Automatically stops music when the app is launched (it doesn't really matter just fyi) Overall this have to be the worst mobile banking app I have tried so far and should not be released with all these bugs & issues.,1,2025-08-02 16:36:41

"Edit: New bug, app not letting me type in my otp codes. Shameful Why does this app not allow me to use it while having developer options on? Did y'all consider that I might, perhaps, be an actual developer? Why am I expected to toggle the option on and off just to bank (restarting my phone when I do)? Why is the message labled as somthing that will ""smoothen"" the experience? This is like the most ""security consultant"" thing to implement in an app. Please invest in actual security, not this mess.",1,2025-03-12 22:41:25

"I will give only one star, because it faced with multiple of problems. 1. The app is not as fast as the other banks App, for e.g like CBE 2. The App asks repeatedly to switch off developer options, even if it is switched off. 3. Bank of Abyssinia's services are interesting, but they ignored the issues on the App service. 4. Most customers gave a complain on the App, but no one accept their complain to fix the issue. 5. Lastly, I will not recommend the App unless the issue has been solved ASAP!!",1,2025-01-03 07:56:58

It has been a while since you guys started giving the mobile app service but still couldn't get it to work.

I hope you can provide an update soon.",4,2024-12-08 23:16:05

"Shockingly bad! Even when it decides to work, it's painfully slow and frustrating. Such a shame that it has become a stain on an extraordinary bank",1,2024-09-06 19:16:55
"It crashes frequently. It launches on Android 8.1 but I don't think it actually works on versions less than 10. If so, it shouldn't be available for download by such devices to begin with, like many other finance apps are not. It was so much better three months ago, upgrades should be for the better.",1,2024-09-06 10:06:12
