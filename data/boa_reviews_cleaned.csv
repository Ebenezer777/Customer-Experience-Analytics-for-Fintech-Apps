1) crashes repeatedly 2) takes century to boot 3) repeatedly requires update which is very annoying. 4) it doesn't ask for password for one step confirmation when transferring money. 5) automatically stops music when the app is launched (it doesn't really matter just fyi) overall this have to be the worst mobile banking app i have tried so far and should not be released with all these bugs & issues.,1,2025-08-02

it has been a while since you guys started giving the mobile app service but still couldn't get it to work. i'm sure you know that it doesn't work already but not sure if you're lazy or incompetent to fix it. you are losing business because of this. complacency will have consequences.,1,2024-12-10
"this is the best app; many features are awesome, but it should work without the need to turn off the developer options. i'm tired of having to constantly switch the developer options off and on. i've been expressing my struggles about this. i have precious settings enabled in the developer options, and to open the app boa app, i have to turn them off. please help us, abyssinia bank. i hope you can provide an update soon.",4,2024-12-08
"i’m giving this app one star because there are no options below that. my experience has been incredibly frustrating due to the extremely long loading times, and the app even closes automatically at times. people choose mobile banking for its convenience, but this app is far too time-consuming, making it the worst i’ve used. i hope improvements are made to enhance the user experience.",1,2024-12-07
very unprofessional and mischievous bank in my opinion. i have had several occasions but recently i used abyssinia card to withdraw money and it was deducted from my account but despite reporting several times they said they are processing it but i learned yesterday that since it has been 3 months the bank has decided to include it in their income. how absurd. if you can avoid this bank.,1,2024-12-06

"i have a worst experience while using this mobile application through out the year. most of the time it fails to ""login"" or automatically closed the app. and also it takes so much loading time (5 minutes +) trying to access the internal services. sometimes also while transferring within and to other bank also fails. so, boa please fix your app.",1,2024-11-29
i don't know why but your apps start out great then all of a sudden don't work🤷‍♀️,1,2024-11-28

"terrible bank experience it’s unbelievable that with all the modern technology, this bank still struggles with even basic transactions. the app constantly crashes, services are limited, and every time i try to transfer money or load telebirr, there’s a huge delay. i have to wait 5 days for failed transactions to be refunded! even ussd is unreliable. they’ve put me in embarrassing situations countless times, and customer care never fixes anything. i’ve switched banks, and you should too!",1,2024-10-14
