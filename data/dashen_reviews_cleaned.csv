"this so-called “super app” is a complete disappointment. it’s confusing, slow, and full of glitches honestly, it feels like it was designed to test people’s patience, not to help them bank. calling it “super” is a joke; it’s one of the most useless apps i’ve ever used.",1,2025-11-11

"dashen superapp is the worst app for me because it consistently fails during transfers. when i try to send money, the transaction freezes for extended periods—sometimes a full day, and often two or three days or more. crucially, the funds are neither delivered to the recipient nor immediately refunded to my account, which is incredibly frustrating and makes me feel like i've lost my money. the app urgently needs a technical update to ensure transactions process smoothly and reliably.",1,2025-10-14

"@shewangizaw l. as a heavy user of the app , the issue you raised around resetting pass pin concerned me and gave it a try and found it to be safe. basically the app will do two things: verifies one using an otp and then requires an in-person visit to bank's physical branch for final verification after resetting the password. therefore, safe to use! i wish ""i""nformational tip was added around the reset button. could not attach screenshot.",4,2025-10-06

i have one issue though what if the mobile phone with the sim is stolen and have no pattern or pin. the app allows to reset the pin directly without 2fa like finger print just by sending sms. which is a big gap. it should be addressed i didn't expect but it does and no trust at all.,1,2025-09-28

"i am very disappointed with the dashin bank super app. the app does not allow me to withdraw 50 birr or can't transfer money and even i can't use it to buy airtime. this makes me feel like my 50 birr is no longer my money, but the bank’s money, since i cannot access or use it freely. according to the national bank of ethiopia (nbe), the rule is that 100 birr is not withdrawable, but it can be used to buy airtime or transferred to friends. dashin bank’s restriction goes beyond this rule and unfa",1,2025-09-06
